# How to GitHub
This is a high-level tutorial for setting up and using GitHub, and Jupyter Notebooks.

### The Objectives
- Introduce [GitHub](https://github.com/) and some terminology
- Walk-through creating a work GitHub account
- Setup [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), and our Integrated Developer Environment (IDE)
- Create our first [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (supports Python and R)
- Make our first commit, and push to a repo on our work GitHub account
- Move a repo from our work GitHub account to the Organizational account


If you have not used GitHub before, do not fret, it's a pretty simple tool, but a powerful 
one at that. For those who regularly use RStudio, the extensive tutorial 
series: ["Happy Git and GitHub for the useR"](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html), 
by Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester has been recommended multiple times, 
definitely check it out!

Let's start with some basic definitions!

### The Ecosystem
- Git - installed on your computer; it allows groups of developers to collaborate on the same documents (often source code) simultaneously and without overriding each other’s work.
- Version Control - a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
- GitHub - allows developers to host their files in a ‘Git Repository’ so that other people can collaborate on projects with them, whether they are open for public contribution (open source) or closed for specific colleagues to work on a private project.
- GitHub Desktop - an application that enables you to interact with GitHub using a GUI instead of the command line or a web browser. GitHub Desktop encourages you and your team to collaborate using best practices with Git and GitHub.
- Repository - a repo is essentially a project’s folder, much like the kind of folder you would see in a Dropbox or Google Drive folder.  
- IDE - is software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single GUI; R Studio is an IDE, for example.

### The Actions
- Commit -  a commit or revision is like ‘saving’ an updated file to its original folder and overwrites an older version.
- Clone - literally clones (copies) of a repository that sit on the developer’s computer instead of a server elsewhere.
- Branch - a parallel version of a repository (ie; it literally branches out or away from the main repository, kind of like a temporary sub-folder).
- Fetch - refers to getting the latest changes from an online repository (like GitHub.com) without merging them in.
- Fork - a ‘fork’ is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your GitHub account; forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original.
- Push - refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository such as GitHub.com.
- Issue - suggested improvements, tasks or questions related to the repository; created by anyone (for public repositories), and are moderated by repository collaborators.
- Blame - describes the last modification to each line of a file, which generally displays the revision, author and time. This is helpful, for example, in tracking down when a feature was added, or which commit led to a particular bug.
- Pull Request -a mechanism for a developer to notify team members that they have completed a feature.
- Merge - takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.
