# How_to_GitHub (Tutorials)
Well hello there! Fancy seeing you here. 
  
This folder contains the tutorials that were
discussed on the previous page; tutorials are in the form of Jupyter Notebooks, which
can be in Python and R (more on that later). Check out the Notebooks for more information
on the particular topic.
