# How to GitHub (Tutorials)
Well hello there! Fancy seeing you here. 
  
This folder contains the tutorials that were
discussed on the previous page; tutorials are in the form of Jupyter Notebooks, which
can be written with Python, R, Markdown, LaTeX and many more (more on that later). 

Check out the Notebooks for more information on the particular topic.
